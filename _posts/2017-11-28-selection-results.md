When the personal interview phase was completed, I had to throughly listen to
each of the interviews in order to find qualities in each candidate such as
perseverance, patience, curiosity, creativity, organization, dedication, and
honesty. I also used the results of the online personality tests to corroborate
the strengths and weaknesses of each personality type. In order to avoid being bias, I
asked some friends of mine to also listen to the interviews and provide some
feedback, so I could have different outlooks of each applicant.

Once all data was collected, an algorithm was designed to process this information
and obtain the students for the course. This algorithm consisted of giving a weight
of 60% to the technical test, 35% to the personal interview, and 5% to the shown personal
traits. In addition, because this course promotes gender equality, there was a condition
to select 4 male and 4 female candidates. There was also another condition considering
that students from 10th grade had less experience with the topics of the technical tests.

One of my closes friends
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nanci-abarca-22430b38/">Nanci Abarca</a>, who has a keen interest in data science, was the
one in charge of processing all data, implementing the algorithm, and providing the results.
She developed a
  <a target="_blank" href="http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Sikae/SelectionProcessCS50Puyo/blob/master/SelectionProcessCS50Puyo.ipynb">jupyter notebook</a>
which contains the information about the selection process of the CS50 AP Puyo,
and it also provides some insights about the results of each phase. These results
were delivered to the authorities at San Vicente Ferrer high school to make them aware of
the low performance in math and the good values students have.

Once I knew the selected students, I notified them through email that their application
was successful. They all agreed with some
  <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKCAjcH_hO-ajf5_24X0KRmDDu3DrC0ftBDIDRvxfrE/edit?usp=sharing">terms and conditions</a>
I established in order to
avoid problems in the long term such as their parents' complaining about their kids
having a lower academic performance due to the course or students not taking
care of the high school facilities. Another important condition was that they will
have to be teaching assistants the next time the course is offered, so more people
have the opportunity to learn coding.

Telling the other applicants that their application was successful was one of the
most difficult things I have done in my entire life. I thought of myself as a person
in those admission committees that receives thousands of applications each year, but
unfortunately there are just few spots available, and they have, somehow, to choose
the most promising applicants. I sent an email which was brief and precise about
the rejection, and I added some links to courses they could follow by their own
in case they cannot wait for the next version to begin.

These are the students who were selected to take the beta version of the course
CS50 AP Puyo. They have been listed alphabetically by their names:

* Christian Santamaría
* Daniel Velin
* Dayra Yasacama
* Edwin León
* Naydelin Pérez
* Sebastián Illicachi
* Thaily Ribadeneira
* Yadira De La Torre
