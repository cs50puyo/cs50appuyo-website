Based on the math curriculum when I was in high school, I had a vague idea about
the topics to consider for

such as properties of exponents and radicals, linear equation systems,
factoring, and basic geometry.
I also wanted to make this test a little bit challenging, so the applicants
could show they are not the kind of people who memorize formulas without understanding
them. Besides, I did not allow the use of a calculator because the computations
involved were very simple. I used questions that have been appeared in SAT and GRE math tests.
Undoubtedly, some of these questions were difficult, but I needed to make sure
I was getting students who were ambitious and perspicacious.
In addition, I wanted to test their creativity, so I included some personal opinion questions.

I had my concerns about the difficulty of the technical test, so I talked with the
teacher in charge of the math commission in high school, David Guano. He was my teacher
when I studied there, and it was a pretty nice experience to talk with him once again.
He told me that the test looked a bit complex, but all topics in the test had been covered,
so the students, in theory, were able to solve them. He was also expecting to see the results.
Some of my friends also reviewed the test, and they agreed that it was not an easy test,
but they also stated that it was a good way to select promising students.

On October 14, 2017, the test was taken, and there were 26 applicants. Silvia Moya, the
vice principal was surprised that almost all students who attended the talk were applying,
and I was very glad to see the room where the test was taken almost full. They had 90 minutes
to solve the test, and I gave them some instructions as calculators were not allowed, which response
was an "oh nooo", and that they should not even think about cheating because that was going
to take them out of the process. After the test, I wanted to start grading as soon as possible
to see how well they did on it, so I went to a cafeteria where I planned to be grading at
least the math section.

While grading, I was very sad to see that most people did not do well on the test, and after two
hours grading every single question of the math tests I realized that I had to grade not only
if an answer was correct or not, but also the effort they did or if they were showing some kind
of reasoning about the question. Two friends of mine also helped me grading some exams, so
at the end of that night I had 18 people who showed, somehow, problem solving skills and
creativity. They were notified via email to continue with the second phase of the application
process.
