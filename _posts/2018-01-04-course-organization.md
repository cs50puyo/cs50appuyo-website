The parents of the selected students had to sign an authorization recognizing
they were aware of the
[terms and conditions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AKCAjcH_hO-ajf5_24X0KRmDDu3DrC0ftBDIDRvxfrE/edit?usp=sharing) of the course. Fortunately, all of them signed them without complaints,
so the8 (as I began calling the 8 selected students) just had to wait until
January 9th, 2018 to dive into the world of computer science and the art of programming.

Preparing the content for the course was not an easy task. Even though there
were many resources available from
[CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/),
[CS50 AP](https://ap.cs50.net/),
[MITx 6.00.1x](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-mitx-6-00-1x-11),
and many other courses, I had to adapt the course, so that the main language is
Python, and the classes were entertaining as David J. Malan's lectures.

Once again my friend Nanci Abarca, a.k.a. Sika, was crucial to organize the contents of the course. As
a guide, we decided to use the book
[Practical Programming An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3.6](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1680502689/ref=dp_ob_title_bk)
written by
[Paul Gries](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~pgries/),
[Jennifer Campbell](https://jencampbell.github.io/), and
[Jason Montojo](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/3525).
In addition, we selected some programming exercises from the book
[Introduction to Programming Using Python](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Programming-Using-Python-Daniel/dp/0132747189/)
written by
[Daniel Liang](http://www.cs.armstrong.edu/liang/). This book was
very useful when I was learning how to code, and those exercises helped me to
understand the basics of programming.

Moreover, I wanted to create a way to document what was done in the course,
so any person that also wanted to teach programming to people without prior
experience could use the resources that were generated in this course. Thus,
the main purposes of this blog are to document the most relevant events of the
course and to provide free access to the resources that were generated during
the course.

I pledged to do my best in order to generate a good quality course. I really
wanted to teach computer science because I strongly believe that coding skills
are crucial in our fast-paced society. I wish that the8 loved to attend
the classes as when I was so excited to play the CS50's lectures one after the
other. Sika suggested that I should focus on making sure they
understand the basics well since knowing this building blocks would allow
them to learn by themselves anything they want later.

Preparing the classes was not an easy task, and I realized that being a good
teacher requires lots of effort and time. I hope someday school and high school
teachers were paid as medical doctors not only in Finland but worldwide
because they are the ones who can make a better society by encouraging young
souls the pursuit of truth and the commitment to excellence, so they can build
together a better society.

Finally, before ending this post, I want to thank the company that I work for
[Band of Coders](http://bandofcoders.com/) which is sponsoring pizza days for
the students and people who are helping with the course. All of these was
possible thanks to the initiative of my boss and friend Chris Charles who
talked with the owner of the company, and got approved budget to have
pizza days once a month during the course is running.
