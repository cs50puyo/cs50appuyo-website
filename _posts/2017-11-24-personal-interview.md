Eighteen students were notified that they had passed to the second phase of
the CS50 AP Puyo's selection process. In addition, they were asked to complete
a personality tests which is based on Jung's and Briggs Myers' typology.
When all of them sent the results of the personality tests, they were randomly
scheduled for a personal interview. In order to avoid some applicants in advantage
of the others, they were sent six of the ten questions of the interview, and the
remaining four questions were selected randomly from a list of 30 questions.

On November 21st, 2017 the interviews started. Each interview took 25 minutes on
average, and the main purpose was to know more about the attitude of each applicant.
I can state that all candidates shown they were kind and polite. The personality
test they previously was helpful because I was able to deal with the students
that were either extrovert or introvert. I should recognize that San Vicente Ferrer
High School has done an outstanding job fostering values among their alumni.
Therefore, considering the results of the technical test, it was a subtle task to
determine the students who were going to obtain the eight available seats for the course.

I conducted 4 or 5 interviews every day, and I recorded every single interview in order
to ask some of my friends to evaluate the candidates so that I could have different outlooks.
It was becoming harder to choose them because all of the were showing relevant qualities.
Thus, I focused on people who were showing ambition, curiosity, creativity, responsibility, hard-work,
dedication, organization, and honesty based on their answers. During each interview I tried to
push each candidate to his limit because the course was not going to be an easy course.
I knew in advance that the selected students were going to be discourage more than once, so
I was looking for a clear signal that they were people who love challenges, and I also
wanted people who were going to support and help other people, so they could get motivated
as a team.

It was a Friday, October 24th, 2017, and I had completed the interviews. At these point, I
was thinking about selecting 16 students because I did not want these students to feel
bad for being rejected. Nonetheless, it was going to be hard to manage 16 students, and
for a moment, I even thought of taking 12 of them because that number was a good number
to divide students into groups of 2, 3, 4 or six. I was feeling as a recruiter of a top
university that sees many potential candidates, but there are just a limited amount
of slots available. In the end, I had to put my feelings aside, and I continued with the
original plan of having 8 seats available.
