After obtaining the approval to teach CS50 AP, I decided to make a presentation
to motivate students to apply for this course.
Even though I wanted to teach to everybody that was eager to learn coding, I was
aware that I was doing this mostly by myself, and I was also keeping in mind that
the main goal was to demonstrate the importance of learning coding skills, so I
decided to be very selective with the students taking the beta version of course.
I established that I was going to have just 8 seats available for the course because
that was a number of people I could handle by myself, and I also wanted these
students to be TAs (teacher assistants) in the next version of the course.

Initially, I wanted to teach CS50 as it is taught in Harvard University, but
because the people who were taking the course were high school students I changed
the main programming language from C to Python. I also added some useful resources
from other programming courses, tutorials, and book that I knew are good for learning
Python. However, I was going to teach programming in a fun way, review assignments,
provide feedback on how well the students were doing in the course, and also I was
going to make some sessions in which they could practice programming and the concepts
reviewed in the classes. In addition, I had in mind to have some lunches or
meals to share experiences about the course and know better the students.
All of these are ideas taken from CS50.

Therefore, I asked the vice principal Silvia Moya to gather the
students in 10th and 11th grade, I excluded students from 12th grade (seniors)
because they were going to be busy studying for an exam that allows them to apply
to public universities, that have shown good problem solving skills. Silvia
did an outstanding job asking math and physics teachers about the students that satisfy
this condition, and she also set up responsibly everything for the talk that was given on
October 6th, 2017. Students did not know either the reason why they were called to attend a talk,
nor the topic of the talk. Therefore, all of them were thrilled when I started talking.

Essentially, I explained the reason why people should learn how to code not matter the
major they decided to study. I explained them that the main thing was learning a new way
of thinking known as computational thinking, i.e., think of a problem in terms of a computer,
so that I can give the problem to the computer, and it can solve it very fast. Then, I told them
about the CS50 AP Puyo course, and I clearly state that the final goal is to make this programming
course available to everybody in high school, but because it was a beta version, I was going to
start just with 8 students. Next, I explain them that the selection process consisted of a
technical tests, evaluating math, reasoning, and creative skills; a personality tests, which is
based on Carl Jung’s and Isabel Briggs Myers’ typology; and a personal interview, in order
to know more about the applicants' skills.

Finally, I told them that the first phase of the selection process, i.e., the technical test
was going to be on October 14th, 2017. In addition, Silvia Moya made an very motivational
speech encouraging students to apply to the selection process of CS50 AP Puyo, and
she repeated several times that this was a unique opportunity, and she also told them
that I was an outstanding students when I was in high school. The students left the room,
but I could clearly see their faces full of enthusiasm.
