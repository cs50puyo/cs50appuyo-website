I took CS50 through edX in 2014, and this course completely changed my life.
Even though I didn't study computer science or software engineering, with
the knowledge I got taking CS50 I was able to participate in a programming
contest called <a href="https://www.devsucodejam.com/" target="_blank">Devsu Code Jam</a>
and being awarded fourth place. CS50 gave me the opportunity to start a career
in the software industry, and nowadays I am working as a software developer
remotely from my hometown.

After finishing university and being working a couple of years
in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, I decided to go back to my hometown, a city called Puyo.
The main reason to move was that I was stressed from the big city, and
because I was working remotely, I felt I had no strings attached in the big city.
Back in Puyo, I was usually thinking of how CS50 has changed the lives of lots
of people around the world including mine, and I wanted that people from Puyo have
the opportunity to taste what CS50 is.

It was August 2017, and I contacted some high school teachers of mine. I told them that
this course is taught in Harvard University, and I also told them my story, so
they got excited about students from the one who was my high school
taking this course. At the same time I knew that several subjects that teach
computer skills had been removed because they were seen as not so important,
and this removal motivated me even more to begin a beta programming course.

A teacher of mine called Silvia Moya, who also was my tutor when I was in high school, was eager to see
the results that a beta version of CS50 could have, so she helped me to talk with the principal about
this project. Fortunately, the principal, Daniel Zúñiga, agreed with this beta course, and he also
allowed me to use the high school facilities. This was crucial because this course was official
approved by the high school, so the parents of the students taking this course were not going to be worried
about their kids taking a course with somebody that was a complete stranger.

At this moment, I had just the approval to teach the course, but I had no idea what else to do.
I had a big deal of ideas in my mind, but none of them were clear, so I started taking with some
of my closest friends Nanci Abarca, David Ochoa, Diego Vaca and my boss, but also friend Chris Charles.
They not only gave me more excellent ideas, but also they helped me clarify mine. I understood that
the next step was to make a talk about the importance of programming so I could get the attention
of the students in my high school.
