  introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art
  of programming, <a target="_blank" href="https://ap.cs50.net/">CS50 AP</a> is a free
  adaptation of CS50 for high schools, and CS50 AP Puyo is a modified version

<p>
  This is a beta project which goal is to show the importance of teaching
  coding skills to high school students.
  The classes are taught in a high school called
  <a target="_blank" href="https://web.vicentino.edu.ec/">San Vicente Ferrer</a> because
  this was the high school where
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/lmiguelvargasf/">the instructor</a>
  studied, so the teachers, who already know him, supported his idea of
  teaching a beta programming course, and the principal allowed him to use the
  high school's facilities completely for free.
